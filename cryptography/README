Common Conventions:
	1. All plaintexts are assumed(and handled) as lowercase letters
	2. All ciphertexts are assumed(and handled) as uppercase letters

	3. All substitution ciphers encrypt/decrypt only alphabets.
	4. Non-alphabetic characters appear as-is on the (encrypted)ciphertext/(decrypted)plaintext
