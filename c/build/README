HOWTO use this Makefile system


############ GlobalMake is now **DEPRECATED**, Use Makefile.inc instead ###############

*******
 USAGE 
*******

******************************************
	I. Build libraries and testcases
******************************************

0. cd <library_folder>; touch Makefile

1. Start with defining the C Development root relative to the current directory
# C Development root
BASE_DIR=../..

2. Define directories where the header files are located
# include flags for the compiler
INCLUDE += -I$(PWD) -I../include -I$(BASE_DIR)/common/include 
TEST_INCLUDE too for testcases

3. Define Library name
# Library name
LIBNAME = <library>

4. Define Multi-threaded library (*OPTIONAL)
# Multi-threaded library name
LIBNAME_MT = <library_mt>

5. Define (sub)directories where sources are located
SUBDIRS += a b c

6. Define (sub)directories where test sources are located
TEST_SUBDIRS = testcases testcases_mt

6. Place Source files (*.c) inside 'src' and include files (*.h) inside 'include' directories
e.g:
a/src a/include
b/src b/include
a/testcases/src a/testcases/include
a/testcases_mt/src a/testcases_mt/include

7. Define sourcefiles for testcases that need the single-threaded library 
TEST_SRCS += test_a.c
TEST_SRCS += test_b.c 

8. Define sourcefiles for testcases that need the multi-threaded library
TEST_SRC_MT += test_a_mt.c 

9. Test common files -- are files needed by all testcases
TEST_COMMON_SRCS += test_common.c
TEST_COMMON_SRCS_MT += test_common_mt.c


10. Linker flags for dependent libraries to compile this library
LDFLAGS += -L$(BASE_DIR)/common/$(OUTDIR) -lcommon 

11. Add reference to this library to be used in the testcases [WARNING: Do not add this to $(LDFLAGS); then the library won't compile.]
LIBS += -L$(OUTDIR) -l $(LIBNAME)
Use LIBS_MT to link with multi-threaded libraries

Define LDFLAGS(_MT) and additionally TEST_LDFLAGS(_MT) if needed.
TEST_LDFLAGS(_MT) are not considered when building libs, 
whereas both LDFLAGS(_MT) and TEST_LDFLAGS(_MT) are used in the commandline for 'tests' target


12. Finally include the "Makefile.inc" file to define all the targets
include $(BASE_DIR)/build/Makefile.inc

13. To build libraries, use
	$ make libs

14. To build testcases, use
	$ make tests

15. Alternately, Use 
	$ make debug
	  to compile both testcases and library with gdb flags
	*OR*
	$ make opt  
	  to compile both testcases and library with -O2
  PS: Just "make" without any targets will also build using "make opt"

******************************************
	II. Build a standalone program
******************************************

0. cd <source_folder>; touch Makefile

1. Define SRC, INCLUDE, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS

2. Use 
	$ make
	  which is equivalent to "make opt"
	*OR*
	$ make debug
	  to compile with debug symbols

*********************
 CURRENT LIMITATIONS
*********************

I. The output folders cannot be changed (out/mac/... for mac, out/linux/... for linux systems) w/o manually editing the GlobalMake

II. Won't compile under windows
