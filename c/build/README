HOWTO use this Makefile system

*******
 USAGE 
*******

0. cd <library_folder>; touch Makefile

1. Start with defining the C Development root relative to the current directory
# C Development root
BASE_DIR=../..

2. Define directories where the header files are located
# include flags for the compiler
INCLUDE += -I$(PWD) -I../include -I$(BASE_DIR)/common/include 

3. Define Library name
# Library name
LIBNAME = <library>

4. Define Multi-threaded library (*OPTIONAL)
# Multi-threaded library name
LIBNAME_MT = <library_mt>

5. Define directory where the testcases are located
# Testcases directory
TESTDIR = <testcases>

6. Source files needed to compile the library (See "CURRENT LIMITATIONS" section)
SRC = a.c b.c c.c
SRC += d.c

7. Define sourcefiles for testcases that need the single-threaded library (See "CURRENT LIMITATIONS" section)
TEST_SRC = test_a/test_a.c
TEST_SRC += test_b/test_b.c 

8. Define sourcefiles for testcases that need the multi-threaded library
TEST_SRC_MT = insert/test_insertMT.c 

9. Linker flags for dependent libraries to compile this library
LDFLAGS += -L$(BASE_DIR)/common/$(OUTDIR) -lcommon -lpthread

10. Add reference to this library to be used in the testcases [WARNING: Do not add this to $(LDFLAGS); then the library won't compile.]
LIBS += -L$(OUTDIR) -l $(LIBNAME)

11. Add referece to the mult-thread version of this library to be used in the testcases
LIBS_MT += -L$(OUTDIR) -l $(LIBNAME_MT) [WARNING: Do not add this to $(LDFLAGS); then the library won't compile.]

12. Finally include the "GlobalMake" file to define all the targets
include $(BASE_DIR)/build/GlobalMake

13. To build libraries, use
	$ make libs

14. To build testcases, use
	$ make tests


*********************
 CURRENT LIMITATIONS
*********************

I. When compiling a library, all the source files need to be under the library directory
   and cannot be arbitrarily organized under folders such as a/a.c, b/b.c, c/c.c etc. [TODO]
   (Testcases source files however, can be organized this way)

II. The variables cannot be changed w/o manually editing the GlobalMake

III. The output folders cannot be changed (out/mac/... for mac, out/linux/... for linux systems) w/o manually editing the GlobalMake
