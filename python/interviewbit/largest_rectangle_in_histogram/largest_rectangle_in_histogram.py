Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given an array of integers A of size N. A represents a histogram i.e A[i] denotes height of
the ith histogramâ€™s bar. Width of each bar is 1.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.

Output Format
Return the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

For Example
Input 1:
    A = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
Output 1:
    10
Explanation 1:
	The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Solution Outline:
	Use a stack to store non-decreasing bar heights.
	Push bars as long as they are > stacktop.
	Each entry in the stack represents the minimum from the bar to the right of it.
	  for e.g.,
	    [(1,0), (2,1), (3,2)]
		[3] is the minimum bar from 3 to 4
		[2] is the minimum bar from 2 to 4
		[1] is the minimum bar overall.
	If the current bar < stacktop, its time to reduce.
	pop until the stack is non-decreasing when current bar is pushed.
	  for each popped item, check the rectangular area possible from it.

	  x, idx = pop()
	  area = (i - idx) * x if stack still has elements in them
	  otherwise
	  area = i * x
	     WHY? because a single element in the stack means its the smallest number so far, 
		 so the area involving it has to be i * x
		   for eg,
		      stack: [(1,3)], i: 5
			  we have processed 5 bars, and the stack has (1,3) [bar of height 1 at index 3)
			  area = 1 * 6
	e.g,
	  bars: [1,2,3,1]
	  if the stack is [(1,0), (2,1), (3,2)]. i = 3
	    pop (3,2), area = (i-2)*3 = 1*3 = 3
		pop(2,1), area = (i-1)*2 = 2*2 == 4
	 
	 At the end, process all the increasing bars in the stack until the stack is empty.
	 [(1,4), (3,5)] for eg,
	   reduce as earlier.
