Graph problems:
   [ ] All paths between two nodes u,v
   [ ] Shortest path between two nodes u,v
       [ ] By number of the edges in the paths
	   [ ] By weight of the edges in the paths
   [ ] Are two nodes u,v connected -- (Union-Find)
   [ ] Cycles
       [ ] Are there negative cycles? (Bellman Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
   [ ] Travelling Salesman Problem
   [ ] Bridges / Articulation points
   [ ] Minimum Spanning Trees (kruskal's, Prim's, Boruvka's)
   [ ] Max flow / flow networks (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's)
